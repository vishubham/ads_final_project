## About
The average retail stock trader or investor has little knowledge about investing and virtually no access to advanced stock data analysis tools. This project aims to provide a useful tool that can be used by retail investors to analyze stock market data and make informed investment decisions.

### Mission
Now a days several apps (e.g., Robinhood, Webull, etc.) have emerged that enable regular folks, i.e., retail investors with small amounts of money, to easily invest in publicly traded stocks. While the trading part has been made easy by these tools, little has been done to educate these small investors and help them in deciding which stocks to buy or sell and when.

The main objective of this project is to provide a stock market data analysis tool that can be used by retail investors to identify long term investment opportunities in stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Once we establish a working model that works for long term investors, the tool can be further developed to add enhanced capabilities to handle instantaneous data analysis for use in day trades.
